### `todo_app_service_configurations`

System-wide configuration items keyed by namespace and key with optional
environment scoping. Holds raw string values with an explicit value_type
for interpretation at runtime. Managed by administrators and referenced
by application services for behavior switches. Optionally linked to a
governing policy [todo_app_service_policies](#todo_app_service_policies) and created by a user
[todo_app_users](#todo_app_users). Records support lifecycle via active flag and

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `todo_app_user_id`: Target user's [todo_app_users.id](#todo_app_users).
- `token`
  > Opaque email verification token. Deprecated for security; prefer storing
  > only token_hash.
- `token_hash`
  > One-way hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the verification token for lookup and
  > uniqueness.

for security and audit. For security, store a one-way token_hash instead
of plaintext.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `todo_app_user_id`
  > Related user's [todo_app_users.id](#todo_app_users) when the email maps to an
  > existing account. Nullable for privacy-preserving requests.
- `email`
  > Email address provided for the reset request. Stored for processing and
  > messaging even if no user exists.

per session to capture who revoked the session and why. Used to audit
logout, security actions, or administrative revocations.

Properties as follows:

### `todo_app_event_types`

Business event taxonomy for todoApp. Each record defines a stable code
and human-readable name for a class of events (e.g., "todo.created",
"todo.completed"). Referenced by [todo_app_business_events](#todo_app_business_events) to
classify occurrences. Enables governance (enable/disable types) and
consistent analytics grouping across the system.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `code`
  > Stable machine-readable identifier of the event type (e.g.,
  > "todo.created"). Used in integrations and analytics and must remain
  > stable.

todo_app_users} and a target [todo_app_todos](#todo_app_todos). Session context via
[todo_app_sessions](#todo_app_sessions) is optional. Stores raw, non-derived attributes
only (timestamps, message, source metadata) for auditability and
analytics ingestion. Referential actions are configured to preserve
history (Restrict on types; SetNull on optional links).

### `todo_app_event_counters_daily`

Daily counters for business events to support KPI queries. Each row
summarizes the count of occurrences for an [todo_app_event_types](#todo_app_event_types)
on a given calendar day bucket. Optionally scoped by actor {@link
todo_app_users} and/or target [todo_app_todos](#todo_app_todos). Maintained by
application processes; contains only raw counts and timestamps (no
derived rollups beyond the defined bucket). Referential actions preserve
history (Restrict on types; SetNull on optional links).
