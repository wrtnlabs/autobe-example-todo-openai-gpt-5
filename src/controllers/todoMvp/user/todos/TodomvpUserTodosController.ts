   * List Todos owned by the authenticated user from Prisma table

   *
   * List the requesting user’s Todos from the todo_mvp_todos table. Each Todo
   * represents a single actionable item owned by one authenticated user as
   * described in the Prisma schema: a required title, optional notes, optional
   * day-level due_date interpreted in the user’s local time context, a simple
   * status ("open" or "completed"), and timestamps for created_at, updated_at,
   * and completed_at (only when completed).
   *
   * Security and permissions: access is restricted to authenticated users and
   * returns only records where todo_mvp_todos.todo_mvp_user_id matches the
   * requester’s identity. The response must not include any other user’s data.
   * Authentication and authorization are enforced by the controller/provider
   * according to session and ownership checks described in the business
   * requirements.
   *
   * Database relationship: todo_mvp_todos.owner relates to todo_mvp_users via
   * todo_mvp_user_id with onDelete: Cascade. No deletion-timestamp column
   * exists on this table; records are physically removed when deleted by design
   * of the MVP’s lifecycle policies. Indexes on (todo_mvp_user_id, status,
   * created_at) and related composites support default list ordering and basic
   * filtering in provider logic.
   *
   * Validation and business logic context: while this endpoint does not
   * validate create/update inputs, clients should expect fields to adhere to
   * rules derived from the schema comments (e.g., title is trimmed and
   * typically 1–120 chars by business rules; notes may be null; completed_at
   * exists only when status is "completed"). Due dates are optional and
   * intended as day-level values.
   *
   * Related operations: creation and modification occur via separate endpoints
   * (e.g., POST/PUT/PUT-Toggle not shown here). This endpoint is designed to be
   * used in conjunction with those to reflect list updates immediately after
   * successful mutations. In case of authorization failure or ownership
   * violations, providers return appropriate errors in line with platform
   * conventions.

  /**
   * Create a new Todo in table todo_mvp_todos owned by the authenticated user.
   *
   * Create a Todo record in todo_mvp_todos for the requesting user. The Prisma
   * schema’s description emphasizes a minimal task model: title (required),
   * optional notes and due_date, and a status constrained to "open" or
   * "completed" with a default of "open" on creation. Timestamps include
   * created_at and updated_at, while completed_at is set only when status
   * becomes "completed".
   *
   * Security and permissions: Only authenticated users may create Todos, and
   * each created row must be associated with the creator’s todo_mvp_users.id
   * (stored in todo_mvp_user_id). Other users’ ownership cannot be specified by
   * clients.
   *
   * Validation and business rules: Title must be non-empty after trimming and
   * within the documented length expectations (typical 1–120 characters). Notes
   * are optional and typically limited to around 1,000 characters as per
   * business guidance. due_date is optional and interpreted at day-level in the
   * user’s local context (stored as timestamptz by schema); invalid dates must
   * be rejected. Status should default to "open"; clients generally should not
   * set completed_at at creation.
   *
   * Related operations: After creation, clients typically call PATCH /todos to
   * refresh the list or GET /todos/{todoId} to fetch full details. Auditing of
   * the creation event, if enabled, is handled internally by system services
   * referencing todo_mvp_audit_events.
   *
   * Error handling: Validation failures result in clear messages and no partial
   * writes. Ownership is enforced server-side, and authentication failures must
   * be denied without exposing other users’ data.

   *
   * Retrieve a list of the caller’s own Todo items from todo_mvp_todos using
   * business-aligned filters and ordering. The underlying Prisma schema
   * documents a simple lifecycle with a required title, optional notes and
   * due_date, a status that is either "open" or "completed", and timestamps for
   * created_at and updated_at, plus completed_at only when status is
   * "completed". This endpoint focuses on list presentation and therefore
   * returns summary information optimized for rendering lists.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Access is restricted to authenticated users and
   * must return only rows where todo_mvp_todos.todo_mvp_user_id equals the
   * authenticated user’s id. No other user’s data can be included.
   * Administrative identities do not browse member content in MVP; enforcement
   * is handled in provider logic.
   *
   * Database relationship context: Each Todo belongs to exactly one user
   * (todo_mvp_users) via a required relation with onDelete: Cascade, ensuring
   * user removal removes their Todos. Audit/event tables
   * (todo_mvp_audit_events) record lifecycle actions but are system-managed
   * artifacts and are not manipulated by this endpoint.
   *
   * Validation and business logic: Filters are limited and predictable—status
   * filter supports "all", "open", and "completed"; default sorting is by
   * created_at descending (newest first). Pagination parameters are required to
   * ensure consistent performance targets. Inputs that specify an invalid
   * status or sort key should be rejected with a validation error.
   *
   * Related operations: Use POST /todos to create new items; GET
   * /todos/{todoId} to view a single item’s full details; PUT /todos/{todoId}
   * to change fields (title, notes, due_date, status). Typical UI will call
   * this endpoint frequently to refresh the visible list after any mutation.
   *
   * Error handling: Validation failures produce clear messages without leaking
   * other users’ information. If the authenticated context is missing, the
   * provider must deny access. Concurrency is not directly relevant for reads,
   * but the list should reflect confirmed writes promptly.
