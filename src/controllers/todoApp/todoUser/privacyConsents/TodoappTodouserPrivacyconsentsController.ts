   * List and search privacy consents (todo_app_privacy_consents) with
   * pagination and filters.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered, sorted, and paginated list of privacy consent records
   * for the current user from the todo_app_privacy_consents table. The table
   * stores user consent history by purpose with fields including purpose_code,
   * purpose_name, granted (boolean), granted_at, revoked_at, expires_at,
   * policy_version, source, ip, and user_agent, plus standard
   * created_at/updated_at and an optional deleted_at for retention workflows.
   * Use this endpoint to audit current and historical consent states without
   * exposing private todo content.
   *
   * Security and permissions: access is restricted to authenticated end users
   * acting on their own records (role "todoUser"). The implementation must
   * apply ownership filtering on todo_app_privacy_consents.todo_app_user_id to
   * ensure cross-user isolation. Administrators should not use this endpoint to
   * view private consent details; separate admin auditing, if required by
   * policy, should operate on aggregated or operational data without exposing
   * private content.
   *
   * Relationship to database entities: each result row corresponds to a record
   * in todo_app_privacy_consents. The list is append-mostly over time as
   * consents are granted and revoked by creating new rows. Consumers typically
   * care about the most recent effective grant for each purpose, but this
   * endpoint exposes the full history enabling clients to compute present
   * status or show timelines.
   *
   * Validation and business logic: the request body
   * (ITodoAppPrivacyConsent.IRequest) may include filters for purpose_code,
   * granted (true/false), date ranges on granted_at/revoked_at/expires_at,
   * free-text search over purpose_name, pagination (page, pageSize with
   * business defaults such as 20 and allowed range 1–100), and sorting fields
   * (e.g., granted_at desc by default). Empty or whitespace-only search
   * keywords should be ignored. Implementers should ensure rate limiting per
   * fairness policies and return only the caller’s own records.
   *
   * Related operations: use GET /privacyConsents/{privacyConsentId} to retrieve
   * a single consent record by its identifier when the client needs complete
   * details. This collection search is intended for list pages, timelines, and
   * settings views where multiple consents are displayed.
   *
   * Error handling: return validation errors for unsupported sort keys,
   * out-of-range page sizes, or malformed date filters; deny access if the user
   * is not authenticated. Records with deleted_at not null are typically
   * excluded from normal results unless the request explicitly asks for
   * archival data via business policy.

  /**
   * Get a single privacy consent (todo_app_privacy_consents) by ID.
   *
   * This operation retrieves one privacy consent record from
   * todo_app_privacy_consents by its primary key. The table models consent
   * history per user and purpose with fields such as purpose_code,
   * purpose_name, granted, granted_at, revoked_at, expires_at, policy_version,
   * source, ip, and user_agent. It also includes created_at, updated_at, and an
   * optional deleted_at used for retention or redaction under policy.
   *
   * Security and permissions: only authenticated end users (role "todoUser")
   * may access their own consent records. The provider must verify ownership by
   * comparing the record’s todo_app_user_id to the caller’s identity and deny
   * access without revealing existence if the record belongs to a different
   * user. Administrators should not use this endpoint for routine operations,
   * as private consent details are not intended for administrative browsing.
   *
   * Entity relationship context: a consent record is independent of todos and
   * represents a single event in the consent timeline for a given purpose.
   * Clients may use this read to show detailed consent information in settings
   * screens, including timestamps, policy_version, and capture source.
   *
   * Error handling and behavior: if privacyConsentId does not exist or refers
   * to a record that the user does not own, return an authorization-safe
   * denial. Records with a non-null deleted_at are considered archived and
   * normally not returned unless business policy permits. Validation must
   * ensure privacyConsentId is a UUID.
