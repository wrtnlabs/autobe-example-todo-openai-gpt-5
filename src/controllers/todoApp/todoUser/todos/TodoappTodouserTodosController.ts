   * defines: id (UUID), todo_app_user_id (owner), title (required short text;
   * business rule 1–120 characters after trimming), description (optional
   * longer text, commonly limited by policy to 1000–2000 chars), due_at
   * (optional timestamptz in the owner’s timezone), status (expected 'open' or
   * 'completed'), completed_at (null on creation), created_at, updated_at, and
   * a deleted_at field used by the system to exclude records from normal views.
   * On successful creation, implementation sets status to 'open', records
   * timestamps, and associates ownership via todo_app_user_id.
   *
   * Security and validation: Only authenticated users can create Todos; the
   * service assigns todo_app_user_id from the caller’s identity and validates
   * inputs. The title must be non-empty after trimming and within the allowed
   * length. Description and due_at are optional with policy-based constraints;
   * due_at must be a valid date-time. The result returns the full ITodoAppTodo
   * to support immediate UI rendering. System artifacts like activity logs and
   * business events may be recorded automatically by the service as side
   * effects and are not part of the request.
   *
   * Related operations: After creation, clients generally call GET

   * stores: id (UUID), todo_app_user_id (owner reference to todo_app_users),
   * title (required), description (optional), due_at (optional timestamptz
   * interpreted in the owner’s timezone), status (expected business values

   * longer (typically up to 1000–2000 chars by policy). The list view MUST
   * scope results to the authenticated user via todo_app_user_id and exclude
   * records where deleted_at is not null.
   *
   * Security and permissions: access is restricted to authenticated end users
   * acting as owners of their own Todos. The operation must enforce owner
   * isolation using the relationship from todo_app_todos.todo_app_user_id to
   * todo_app_users.id. Administrative or system-generated tables (e.g.,
   * activity trails, business events, counters) are not exposed or modified by
   * this endpoint. Rate-limiting and throttling may be applied according to
   * governance policies but are out of scope of this API contract.
   *
   * Filtering, search, and sorting: the request body ITodoAppTodo.IRequest
   * conveys pagination (page number and size within 1–100), status filters
   * (open/completed/all), optional due-window filters (e.g., overdue, dueToday,
   * future), and a keyword query applied case-insensitively to title and
   * description. By default, results sort by created_at descending (newest
   * first). When sorting by due_at ascending, items without due_at should
   * appear after those with a due date; ties may be resolved by created_at
   * descending. The response is a paginated container
   * IPageITodoAppTodo.ISummary encapsulating list data and pagination metadata
   * suitable for UI list rendering.
   *
   * Related operations: use GET /todoApp/todoUser/todos to create via POST
   * /todoApp/todoUser/todos, GET /todoApp/todoUser/todos/{todoId} to retrieve a
   * single Todo’s full details, and PUT /todoApp/todoUser/todos/{todoId} to
   * update fields or toggle completion. System-generated records like
   * todo_app_todo_activities or todo_app_business_events are written by service
   * logic as side effects and do not have manual write endpoints in this set.

  /**
   * Delete a Todo by ID in todo_app_todos using soft deletion and record audit
   * entries.
   *
   * Delete a single Todo belonging to the caller. The underlying Prisma model
   * is todo_app_todos, which stores ownership (todo_app_user_id), core fields
   * (title, description, due_at, status), and lifecycle timestamps (created_at,
   * updated_at, completed_at). The model includes a deleted_at column that,
   * when set, excludes the record from normal listings. This endpoint sets
   * deleted_at to the current time to implement the schema-supported deletion
   * behavior, preserving privacy and enabling recovery windows and auditability
   * described in related tables.
   *
   * Security and authorization: Only a user with role todoUser acting on their
   * own record may delete it. The service must confirm that the path todoId
   * resolves to a row where todo_app_todos.todo_app_user_id equals the
   * authenticated user’s id. If not, deny without revealing whether the Todo
   * exists, consistent with access-control requirements.
   *
   * Relationships and audit trail: Related append-only audit models include
   * todo_app_todo_deletion_events (records occurred_at, optional reason, and
   * links to the todo and deleter) and todo_app_todo_activities (records
   * activity_type such as 'delete', details, changed_fields, and timestamps).
   * Providers should create these audit entries as part of the deletion
   * workflow to preserve a historical trail. Optionally, providers may also
   * emit todo_app_business_events for analytics using a suitable event type.
   *
   * Validation and behavior: If the Todo has already been marked deleted
   * (deleted_at not null), the operation should be treated as
   * idempotent—perform no additional state changes and return success without
   * error. If the todoId is not a valid UUID or cannot be resolved (with
   * ownership), respond with a suitable error. No request body is required, and
   * no response body is returned upon success. This operation performs a soft
   * deletion as indicated by the presence of the deleted_at column in the
   * Prisma schema, not a permanent physical removal.
   *
   * Related operations: Use PATCH /todoApp/todoUser/todos/{todoId}/activities
   * to review the activity history recorded in todo_app_todo_activities and
   * PATCH /todoApp/todoUser/todos/{todoId}/deletionEvents to inspect deletion
