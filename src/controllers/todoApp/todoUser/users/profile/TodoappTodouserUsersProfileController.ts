   * Get the user profile (todo_app_user_profiles) for the specified userId.
   *
   * This operation fetches the profile attached to a specific account in the
   * todoApp. The underlying Prisma model is todo_app_user_profiles, which
   * stores optional display attributes: full_name, nickname, and an avatar_uri
   * that points to an image resource as a URI string. The relation is
   * one-to-one with todo_app_users through the
   * todo_app_user_profiles.todo_app_user_id foreign key. The profile record
   * also contains created_at and updated_at timestamps for auditability and a
   * deleted_at timestamp used to hide records from normal flows.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Only authenticated end users should retrieve
   * their own profile. Although the route encodes a {userId} parameter, the
   * provider function must verify that the authenticated principal’s id matches
   * userId to prevent cross-user access. Administrators do not routinely access
   * private profile content in MVP; therefore, authorization is restricted to
   * todoUser.
   *
   * Relationships and lookup behavior: The request uses userId (UUID) that
   * corresponds to todo_app_users.id. The service locates the profile by the
   * unique constraint on todo_app_user_profiles.todo_app_user_id. If no profile
   * exists for the user, the service returns a not-found condition consistent
   * with business error handling policies.
   *
   * Validation and business logic: No request body is required. The handler
   * should ignore profile records where deleted_at is set. If multiple records
   * exist due to data inconsistency (should not happen because of
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param userId Unique identifier of the user whose profile is requested.
   * @@unique on todo_app_user_id), the service must treat it as an error.
   *
   * Related operations: Creation and update of the profile are handled by
   * POST and PUT on the same resource path. Error handling follows the
   * authentication and privacy guidance: deny access when the path userId
   * does not match the authenticated user, and do not reveal existence of
   * other users’ data.

  /**

   * Purpose: Insert a new profile associated to the user identified by

   * fields: full_name, nickname, and avatar_uri (URI string up to 80,000
   * characters), along with created_at/updated_at timestamps and a deleted_at
   * timestamp for lifecycle governance. A one-to-one link is enforced through a

   *
   * Security: Only the authenticated owner (todoUser) can create their profile.
   * The handler must verify that the authenticated user’s id equals the

   * by @@unique on todo_app_user_id), the service should return a conflict
   * error and advise using the update endpoint instead.
   *
   * Validation and business rules: Input values should be trimmed and validated
   * according to presentation rules. avatar_uri must be a valid URI; services
   * should treat it as a reference string (no file upload in this API). Records
   * with deleted_at should not be recreated without explicit recovery
   * policy—attempting to recreate a profile where a logically removed row still
   * exists should be handled according to business rules (typically conflict).
   *
   * Related operations: GET returns the existing profile, PUT updates an
   * existing profile, and this POST creates the first profile row for the user.
   * Errors include unauthorized when path does not match the authenticated
   * principal and conflict when a profile already exists.

  /**

   * presentation data (full_name, nickname, avatar_uri) and timestamps
   * (created_at, updated_at). The deleted_at timestamp denotes a record that

   * part of routine operations in MVP.
   *
   * Validation and business logic: The request body contains the fields to
   * update. The service should validate avatar_uri as a URI string and preserve
   * constraints on field lengths. If no profile exists for the user, return
   * not-found and direct the client to create it first. If the profile record
   * is marked with a non-null deleted_at, standard handlers should treat it as
   * unavailable for update unless a separate recovery workflow exists.

  /**
   * Logically delete a user profile (todo_app_user_profiles) by userId.
   *
   * This operation performs a logical removal of a user’s profile in
   * todo_app_user_profiles by setting deleted_at. The profile table stores
   * presentational attributes for a single user (1:1 with todo_app_users)
   * including full_name, nickname, avatar_uri, and timestamps. Deletion hides
   * the profile from standard reads without erasing auditability, aligning with
   * the model’s deleted_at column.
   *
   * Security considerations: only the profile owner (role "todoUser") may
   * delete their profile via this endpoint. The provider must verify that the
   * userId in the path matches the authenticated principal and deny access
   * otherwise without revealing whether a profile exists. Administrative
   * routines should not read private profile attributes without lawful process;
   * operational governance should use separate admin workflows.
   *
   * Entity and relationship context: todo_app_user_profiles has a unique FK to
   * todo_app_users via todo_app_user_id, ensuring at most one profile per
   * account. This endpoint targets the profile by the owning userId rather than
   * a separate profileId to keep the API ergonomic for self-service.
   *
   * Validation rules and business behavior: if no active (non-deleted) profile
   * exists for the specified user, the operation should be idempotent and
   * return a confirmation that no active profile remains. Any cascading effects
   * (e.g., clearing cached avatar) are handled by provider logic. Since
   * deleted_at exists in the schema, the operation marks the record as deleted
   * rather than permanently removing it.
   *
   * Related operations: future profile create/update endpoints would manage
   * full_name, nickname, and avatar_uri. Audit logging of the deletion action
   * is recommended via system audit mechanisms, but those records are
   * system-generated and not exposed for manual writes.
   *
   * Error handling: validate userId format as UUID. Deny when the caller is
   * unauthenticated or attempts cross-user access. If multiple edge cases occur
   * (e.g., concurrent delete), the operation remains idempotent, ensuring the
   * postcondition is that no active profile exists for the user.

   * @param userId Identifier of the owning user whose profile should be deleted
