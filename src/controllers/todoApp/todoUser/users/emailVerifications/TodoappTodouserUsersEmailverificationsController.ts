   * Search email verifications (todo_app_email_verifications) for a user with
   * pagination and filters.
   *
   * List and filter email verification records associated with a user account.
   * The Prisma model todo_app_email_verifications stores id, todo_app_user_id
   * (FK to todo_app_users.id), token and token_hash, target_email, sent_at,
   * expires_at, optional consumed_at, failure_count, optional consumed_by_ip,
   * created_at, updated_at, and a deleted_at marker. These records support
   * account activation and email-change verification flows; for security,
   * responses and logs must avoid exposing raw token secrets.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Only the authenticated owner should view their
   * own verification records. Enforce that the caller corresponds to {userId}.
   * Administrative access is not required during normal operations. Apply rate
   * limiting to mitigate probing.
   *
   * Filtering and sorting: Typical filters include time windows (sent_at,
   * expires_at), consumption state (consumed_at presence), and failure_count
   * ranges. Default sorting may be by sent_at or created_at in descending
   * order. Records with a deletion marker (deleted_at set) are generally
   * excluded from ordinary results.
   *
   * Behavior and errors: Request body (ITodoAppEmailVerification.IRequest)
   * supplies pagination and filter parameters; the response is a paginated
   * summary list. Common errors include invalid UUID format for {userId} and
   * insufficient authorization when attempting to access another user’s data.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param userId Owner user identifier (todo_app_users.id)
   * @param body Search criteria and pagination for email verifications

  /**
   * Get a specific email verification (todo_app_email_verifications) for a
   * user.
   *
   * Fetch a single email verification token record associated with the
   * specified user. The underlying Prisma model todo_app_email_verifications
   * includes fields: id (UUID), todo_app_user_id (FK to todo_app_users.id),
   * token (deprecated in comments), token_hash (preferred for lookups),
   * target_email, sent_at, expires_at, consumed_at, failure_count,
   * consumed_by_ip, created_at, updated_at, and deleted_at. In accordance with
   * the schema comments, implementations should avoid exposing sensitive token
   * values and rely on token_hash for security-sensitive workflows; client
   * responses should prioritize metadata such as target_email and lifecycle
   * timestamps.
   *
   * Security and access control: Only the owner (todoUser) may retrieve their
   * own record. The provider must verify that the path userId matches the
   * authenticated principal and that the requested emailVerificationId is owned
   * by that user (todo_app_email_verifications.todo_app_user_id). Requests from
   * other users must be denied without revealing resource existence.
   *
   * Entity relations and validation: The todo_app_email_verifications record
   * references todo_app_users. This read-only operation does not perform any
   * modifications. It should return records that still exist and are not
   * considered removed (for typical queries, treat rows with a non-null
   * deleted_at as removed from normal access). If the specified id does not
   * exist for the owner, return a not-found response pattern.
   *
   * Related operations: Account lifecycle endpoints (e.g., registration and
   * verification confirmation triggers) are separate write processes and are
   * not covered here. This operation is complementary to user security views
   * and audit diagnostics where applicable.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param userId Owner user’s ID (UUID) of the email verification record
   * @param emailVerificationId Email verification record ID (UUID) to retrieve
