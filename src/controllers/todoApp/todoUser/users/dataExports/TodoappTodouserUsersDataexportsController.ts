   * Create a new personal data export request in todo_app_data_exports.
   *
   * This endpoint allows an authenticated user to initiate a new export job of
   * their personal data. The underlying table todo_app_data_exports captures
   * the job’s lifecycle including status transitions (e.g., requested →
   * processing → completed or failed → expired) and integrity details
   * (checksum, file_size_bytes). The creation flow typically stores minimal
   * user-provided options such as export_format while all other lifecycle
   * attributes are system-managed during processing.
   *
   * Security and permissions: only the resource owner (todoUser) may create an
   * export for their own account. The controller/provider must enforce that the
   * path userId matches the authenticated subject. Administrative roles do not
   * use this endpoint for routine operations. The export record’s ownership is
   * established by setting todo_app_user_id to userId; subsequent retrievals
   * must filter by this relationship.
   *
   * Validation and business rules: validate export_format against supported
   * values (e.g., json or csv per product policy) and apply rate/fair-use
   * limits where configured. Newly created jobs set an initial status such as
   * requested, and do not include download_uri until processing completes.
   * Records with deleted_at set are excluded from normal flows by policy. This
   * operation should not accept system-managed fields like status,
   * download_uri, checksum, completed_at, or expires_at from clients; those are
   * set by processing logic.
   *
   * Related operations: clients typically follow with GET
   * /users/{userId}/dataExports/{dataExportId} to poll status and obtain the
   * download_uri upon completion. Privacy workflows may also include listing
   * and viewing account deletion requests; however, those are separate
   * resources.
   *
   * Error handling: reject invalid input (e.g., unsupported export_format). If
   * rate limits are exceeded, respond with a throttling outcome. Ensure
   * ownership and avoid exposing other users’ records.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param userId Unique identifier of the owner user initiating the export
   * @param body Creation payload specifying export options; system manages
   *   status and processing fields

   * ready), file_size_bytes, checksum, status_message, completed_at,

   * metadata and links only; private todo content is not stored in this table.
   *
   * Security: Access is restricted to the owner (todoUser). The provider must
   * ensure path userId matches the authenticated principal and filter results
   * to rows where todo_app_data_exports.todo_app_user_id equals that user.
   * Access attempts for other users must be denied without indicating whether
   * records exist.
   *
   * List behavior: The request body ITodoAppDataExport.IRequest should support
   * pagination (page size within 1–100, default typically 20), filtering by
   * status (e.g., requested, processing, completed, failed, expired), optional
   * date ranges (created_at, completed_at), and sorting by created_at or
   * completed_at. Exclude rows considered removed from normal access
   * (deleted_at set). For completed entries, download_uri is a URI string and
   * should be treated as sensitive with expiry semantics per expires_at.

  /**
   * Get a user’s data export job by ID from todo_app_data_exports.
   *
   * This operation returns the detailed personal data export job for the
   * specified user and export identifier. In the Prisma schema,
   * todo_app_data_exports represents user-initiated data export requests and
   * tracks lifecycle fields like status (requested, processing, completed,
   * failed, expired), completion timestamps, and an optional download_uri for
   * retrieval once processing is finished. The model also captures request
   * context (request_ip, request_user_agent) and integrity metadata (checksum,
   * file_size_bytes) to support trustworthy downloads.
   *
   * Security and permissions: the result must belong to the authenticated user
   * indicated by userId. Access is limited to the resource owner in line with
   * the privacy and access boundaries described in the business requirements.
   * Administrative roles do not routinely access private export content; this
   * endpoint is intended for end users (todoUser role) to view their own job
   * details. If an export job does not belong to the user or does not exist,
   * the provider should respond without revealing the existence of other users’
   * records.
   *
   * Entity relationships: the export record references todo_app_users via
   * todo_app_user_id. The operation must filter by this FK to enforce
   * ownership. Listings and lookups should normally exclude records marked as
   * deleted via the deleted_at column according to retention policies,
   * returning only active records in normal flows.
   *
   * Validation and behavior: the path parameters must be valid UUIDs. The
   * operation returns the full export job object including status,
   * export_format, and when available, download_uri and expires_at so clients
   * can render a download action. No request body is required. Related
   * operations include POST /users/{userId}/dataExports to create a new export
   * request and search/list operations on account deletion requests for privacy
   * workflows.
   *
   * Error handling: if the export is not found for the given userId and
   * dataExportId pair, return a not-found outcome consistent with access
   * control guidance. Avoid leaking cross-user existence. If the export has
   * expired (expires_at in the past), clients should expect download_uri to be
   * unusable and may initiate a new export.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param userId Unique identifier of the owner user
   * @param dataExportId Unique identifier of the data export job
