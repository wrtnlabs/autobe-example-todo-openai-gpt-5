   * List/search personal data export jobs (todo_app_data_exports) for the

   *
   * This operation returns a filtered and paginated list of personal data
   * export jobs for the signed-in user from the todo_app_data_exports table.
   * The table stores export workflow metadata including status, export_format,
   * download_uri, file_size_bytes, checksum, status_message, completed_at,
   * expires_at, request_ip, request_user_agent, created_at, updated_at, and a
   * logical deletion timestamp used for retention workflows. The owner is
   * linked through todo_app_user_id referencing todo_app_users.id. Results must
   * be restricted to the caller’s own records.
   *
   * Security and permissions: access is restricted to users authenticated as
   * the owner (role: todoUser). The provider must filter by
   * todo_app_data_exports.todo_app_user_id = auth.userId. Administrators may
   * audit exports across users via separate governance endpoints not covered
   * here; this endpoint is strictly user-scoped.
   *
   * Filtering and search: clients can filter by status, export_format, date
   * ranges on created_at, completed_at, and expires_at, and perform free-text
   * search over status_message when supported. Sorting supports created_at,
   * completed_at, and expires_at fields with created_at descending as the
   * default. Pagination follows the user’s preferences (e.g., page_size from
   * todo_app_user_preferences) or explicit request values.
   *
   * Validation and behavior: only records with non-null download_uri should be
   * considered ready for download; clients should honor expires_at to avoid
   * presenting stale links. The status field reflects the job lifecycle (e.g.,
   * requested, processing, completed, failed, expired) as described in the
   * Prisma comments. Records marked for lifecycle retention via the deleted
   * timestamp should be excluded from normal listings by implementation
   * policy.
   *
   * Related operations: use GET /todoApp/todoUser/dataExports/{dataExportId}
   * for details about a specific export job, including its download_uri and
   * timestamps. Creating export jobs is typically initiated by a separate
   * creation endpoint or workflow; this route is for listing and searching
   * existing jobs.

  /**
   * Get a specific data export job (todo_app_data_exports) by ID for the
   * authenticated user.
   *
   * This operation fetches a single data export job from todo_app_data_exports
   * by its primary key id. The model captures the export lifecycle through
   * status and timestamps (created_at, updated_at, completed_at, expires_at)
   * and provides download_uri and file_size_bytes when available. Ownership is
   * enforced via todo_app_user_id referencing todo_app_users.id;
   * implementations must ensure the requested record belongs to the
   * authenticated user.
   *
   * Security: only authenticated users in the todoUser role can access this
   * endpoint and only for their own records. Attempting to access another
   * user’s export must result in a generic denial without revealing existence.
   * Administrators should use separate governance endpoints for cross-user
   * audits.
   *
   * Behavior and validations: if the export is not completed or the expires_at
   * has passed, clients should avoid presenting an invalid download_uri. When
   * status is failed, status_message may include human-readable context. The
   * presence of a logical deletion timestamp indicates records hidden by
   * retention policies and should not be served by this endpoint. The response
   * includes all relevant fields necessary for the user to verify export
   * readiness and audit their request.
   *
   * Related operations: to explore multiple exports with filters and
   * pagination, use PATCH /todoApp/todoUser/dataExports. Export job creation is
   * handled elsewhere in the privacy workflow.
