   * Search and retrieve paginated administrative actions

   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated collection of administrative action
   * history from the todo_app_admin_actions table. The Prisma schema describes
   * this model as “Historical records of privileged administrative operations
   * performed by system administrators. Captures who acted, optional target
   * user, the administrative action, stated reason, and operational notes. Does
   * not store private todo content. Supports governance reviews and incident
   * response. Uses restrictive/set-null deletes on FKs to preserve history.”
   * Fields include admin_user_id (administrator actor), target_user_id
   * (optional), action (administrative action key), reason and notes
   * (human-readable context), success (boolean outcome), idempotency_key
   * (optional uniqueness guard), and timestamps (created_at, updated_at).
   *
   * Security and permissions: Access to this endpoint is restricted to users
   * with the systemAdmin role. These records may reveal sensitive governance
   * activity and must not be exposed to regular members. Implementations should
   * also apply audit logging for viewing sensitive records when appropriate.
   *
   * Database relationships: Each record references the administrator actor via
   * todo_app_users (admin_user_id) and optionally a target user
   * (target_user_id). The list operation must never join or expose private Todo
   * content; it focuses solely on administrative actions metadata as defined in
   * the schema comments.
   *
   * Validation and business logic: The request body supports filters such as
   * admin_user_id, target_user_id, action (exact or partial match), success,
   * creation time window (created_at from/to), and free-text search over
   * reason/notes consistent with GIN trigram indexes noted in the schema.
   * Pagination parameters include page, pageSize (1–100), and sort options by
   * created_at or action. The service should cap page sizes to the configured
   * maximum and apply default ordering by created_at descending if
   * unspecified.
   *
   * Related operations: Use this PATCH /adminActions endpoint to find candidate
   * records; use GET /adminActions/{adminActionId} for detailed inspection of a
   * specific administrative action. Error handling should return clear messages
   * for invalid filters (e.g., malformed UUIDs, out-of-range page sizes) and
   * must not leak information about users outside authorized scope.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Filtering, sorting, and pagination parameters for
   *   administrative actions search.

  /**
   * Get details of one administrative action (todo_app_admin_actions) by ID.
   *
   * This operation returns the detailed administrative action entry identified
   * by adminActionId from the todo_app_admin_actions table. Per the Prisma
   * schema description, this model stores privileged administrative operations
   * with references to the administrator actor (admin_user_id) and an optional
   * target user (target_user_id), the action key, human-readable reason and
   * notes, success boolean, optional idempotency_key, and creation/update

   *
   * Security and permissions: Only systemAdmin users are authorized to access
   * this endpoint. The response must include only the fields defined by the
   * model and avoid revealing private Todo content. Access to identities
   * referenced by admin_user_id or target_user_id should respect account
   * lifecycle policies.
   *
   * Entity relationships: The record links to todo_app_users for both the
   * administrator actor and (optionally) the target user. Implementations may
   * expand or reference related user display information via authorized joins,
   * but must ensure privacy rules are upheld as documented.
   *
   * Validation and errors: The adminActionId path parameter must be a valid
   * UUID corresponding to an existing record. If the record is not found or the
   * caller lacks permission, the service should return an appropriate
   * not-found/forbidden response without disclosing sensitive internal details.
   * This detail endpoint complements the list/search operation PATCH
   * /adminActions.
