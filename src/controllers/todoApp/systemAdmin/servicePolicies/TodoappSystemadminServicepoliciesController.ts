   * salient fields include id (primary key, generated), optional
   * todo_app_user_id referencing the administrative actor, namespace (logical
   * grouping), code (globally unique policy code), name, optional description,

   * effective_from/effective_to, and created_at/updated_at timestamps
   * maintained by the system. Referential relationships include optional
   * linkage from policies to todo_app_service_configurations and
   * todo_app_feature_flags that may reference this policy.
   *
   * Security: Only administrators may create policies, so this endpoint
   * requires systemAdmin authorization. Provider logic must enforce the unique
   * code constraint and validate that value and value_type are coherent. When
   * effectivity windows are provided, the start and end timestamps should be
   * validated for consistency.
   *
   * Expected behavior and error handling: On success, return the newly created
   * policy. If the code is not unique or required fields are missing, return a
   * validation failure. If the request attempts to set fields outside the
   * schema (e.g., unsupported value_type), return an input error. Downstream
   * systems that reference policies by code should treat creation as
   * immediately available once confirmed.

   * Policies may later be updated or archived by separate administrative
   * endpoints according to governance workflows.

   *
   * This operation returns a paginated collection of service policy summaries
   * from todo_app_service_policies. The model defines administrative policy
   * objects with fields including id (primary key), todo_app_user_id
   * (administrator owner/creator), namespace, code (globally unique
   * identifier), name, optional description, value (raw string), value_type
   * (type hint), active (boolean), effective_from and effective_to (optional
   * business effectivity window), and created_at/updated_at timestamps, with a

   * listings. Indexes support lookups across activity state, namespace,
   * temporal windows, and text search on name/description, enabling efficient
   * administrative queries.
   *
   * Security considerations: policies are administrative assets and should only
   * be listed by authorized administrators. Therefore, this endpoint requires
   * systemAdmin privileges. Even within administrative contexts, the response
   * should avoid exposing secrets from other sub‑systems; however, policy
   * values are already modeled as raw strings with value_type hints and are not
   * inherently secret unless business rules dictate otherwise.
   *
   * Validation and business rules include honoring the globally unique code
   * constraint, filtering based on active state and effectivity windows, and
   * supporting pagination parameters (page, pageSize) within expected ranges.
   * Sorting should allow fields such as created_at, updated_at, code, name, or
   * effective_from in ascending or descending order. Related operations
   * typically include policy detail retrieval (GET /servicePolicies/{policyId})
   * and policy creation or update endpoints.
   *
   * Error handling should cover invalid filter combinations (e.g., malformed
   * datetime ranges), out‑of‑bounds pagination, and requests from
   * non‑authorized actors. Records with a logical deletion timestamp should be
   * excluded from standard results.

   * This endpoint fetches one policy record from todo_app_service_policies

   * govern application behavior, rate limits, retention, or other constraints.
   * Key fields include id (primary key), optional todo_app_user_id

   * value_type (type hint for interpretation), active (boolean),

   * to identify archived records that should not appear in normal flows.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Access is intended for administrators, as
   * policies are governance artifacts. The provider should confirm systemAdmin
   * authorization and handle records that are inactive or archived according to
   * administrative visibility rules.
   *
   * Validation and expected behavior: The operation returns the single policy
   * if it exists and is eligible for display; otherwise, it should respond that
   * it was not found. This endpoint complements other administrative operations
   * such as listing/searching policies and creating or updating policies. When

   *
   * This endpoint updates a single policy stored in the
   * todo_app_service_policies table, which “governs application behavior, rate
   * limits, retention, and other constraints.” The model includes columns like
   * id (UUID PK), namespace, code (globally unique), name, description, value
   * (raw string), value_type (type hint), active (boolean), effective_from,
   * effective_to, created_at, updated_at, and deleted_at. The request body
   * should carry only the fields intended to be updated according to business
   * validation (e.g., code uniqueness, proper value_type usage). The provider
   * should set updated_at upon successful write.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Only administrative actors should be able to
   * modify policies. This operation requires a systemAdmin role and should
   * verify the requester’s authorization. Because policies can control critical
   * behaviors, providers should also consider creating audit entries via
   * internal mechanisms (e.g., admin action logs) without exposing audit tables
   * through this API.
   *
   * Entity relationships: Policies may be referenced by
   * todo_app_service_configurations and todo_app_feature_flags through optional
   * FKs. Changing active/effective windows or code must respect the unique
   * [code] constraint and any dependent application logic that resolves
   * policies by code.
   *
   * Validation and business rules: Enforce the @@unique([code]) constraint,
   * ensure value_type is recognized by the application, and verify that
   * effective_from is earlier than effective_to when both are present. Attempts
   * to update immutable identifiers (id) must be rejected. The endpoint path
   * uses policyId which maps to the id column.
   *
   * Related operations: Retrieval and listing of configurations under a policy
   * are available in the serviceConfigurations endpoints. When changing policy
   * activation, downstream readers of configurations or flags may adjust
   * behavior accordingly.
   *
   * Error handling: Return validation errors for uniqueness violations or

   * limits, retention, and other constraints.” The table includes a deleted_at
   * timestamp indicating logical deletion capability. Implementers should mark

   * also deactivate it, ensuring it is excluded from normal reads. Permanent
   * removal (hard delete) should be considered only if explicitly required by

   *
   * Security and permissions: Restricted to systemAdmin. Administrators should
   * ensure no unintended exposure results from removing policies that are
   * currently referenced by todo_app_service_configurations or

   * referencing relations are configured with onDelete: Cascade; a logical
   * deletion will not trigger cascades, so application logic must handle
   * visibility.

   * Relationships and constraints: Policies can be linked from configurations
   * and feature flags. Deleting a policy should be blocked when doing so would
   * violate active operational constraints, or a safety check should
   * warn/require confirmation in provider logic.
