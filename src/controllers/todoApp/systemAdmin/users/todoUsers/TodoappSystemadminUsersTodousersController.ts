   * Search and paginate todoUser role assignment history for a user
   * (todo_app_todousers).
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered, paginated list of role assignment history records for
   * the todoUser role for the specified user. According to the Prisma schema
   * comment for todo_app_todousers, this table stores multiple grant/revoke
   * events over time to preserve audit history, is not user-editable, and is
   * maintained by governance workflows. Each row contains id (UUID),
   * todo_app_user_id, granted_at, optional revoked_at when the assignment
   * ended, created_at, updated_at, and a logical deletion timestamp in
   * deleted_at intended for retention workflows.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Access to role assignment history is restricted
   * to administrative governance. Only system administrators should call this
   * endpoint. The provider must also enforce cross-user isolation by verifying
   * that the path parameter userId corresponds to the targeted account and that
   * the caller has the systemAdmin permission. Non-administrative users must
   * not be able to enumerate another user’s role history.
   *
   * Database relationships and behavior: Results are constrained to rows where
   * todo_app_user_id = {userId}. The design supports multiple historical rows;
   * queries typically order by granted_at (descending) to show most recent role
   * changes first. Filtering may include whether the assignment is currently
   * active (revoked_at is null), as well as granted_at and revoked_at date
   * ranges based on audit needs. Implementations commonly exclude logically
   * removed rows where deleted_at is set. The table is indexed on
   * (todo_app_user_id, granted_at) and (granted_at, created_at) to optimize
   * these access patterns.
   *
   * Validation and business rules: This endpoint is read-only. It must not
   * attempt to create, update, or remove role assignments as these records are
   * system-managed audit history. The request body allows search and pagination
   * parameters (page, pageSize within a 1–100 range), sorting fields such as
   * granted_at or revoked_at, and filters for active-only or specific time
   * windows.
   *
   * Related operations and dependencies: Providers may first validate that the
   * parent user exists via a separate user retrieval operation before executing
   * the list. For detail retrieval of a single assignment, use GET
   * /users/{userId}/todoUsers/{todoUserId}. Error handling should return an
   * authorization error for callers lacking administrative privileges, and a
   * not-found or empty result when the parent user has no matching records.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param userId Owner user’s ID whose todoUser role history is being listed.
   * @param body Search, filter, and pagination parameters for listing todoUser
   *   role assignments.

  /**
   * Get one todoUser role assignment record for a user (todo_app_todousers).
   *
   * This operation returns one historical role assignment entry from
   * todo_app_todousers for the specified user. The schema describes
   * todo_app_todousers as a role assignment history table supporting multiple
   * grant/revoke cycles for auditability, with fields including id (UUID),
   * todo_app_user_id (FK to todo_app_users.id), granted_at, optional
   * revoked_at, created_at, updated_at, and a logical deletion timestamp
   * deleted_at used for retention workflows.
   *
   * Security considerations: Only system administrators may access detailed
   * role assignment history. The provider must check that the caller has
   * administrative permissions and that the requested record belongs to the
   * user identified by {userId}. If the record’s todo_app_user_id does not
   * match the path, return not-found without revealing cross-user details.
   *
   * Entity relationship: The record links to todo_app_users via
   * todo_app_user_id. It is read-only and not user-editable, consistent with
   * the schema comment that governance workflows manage these assignments.
   * Implementations typically exclude logically removed rows where deleted_at
   * is set.
   *
   * Error handling: Return authorization errors for insufficient permissions,
   * not-found when the record does not exist or is not associated with the
   * specified user, and input validation errors for malformed UUIDs. For
   * listing and searching multiple entries instead, use PATCH
   * /users/{userId}/todoUsers.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param userId Owner user’s ID whose todoUser assignment record is queried.
   * @param todoUserId Identifier of the todoUser role assignment record.
