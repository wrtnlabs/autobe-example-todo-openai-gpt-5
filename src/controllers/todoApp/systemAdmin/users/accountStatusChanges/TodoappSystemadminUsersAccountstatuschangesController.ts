  /**
   * Search account status changes for a user (todo_app_account_status_changes).
   *
   * Retrieve account status change history for a given user to support
   * governance reviews, incident investigations, and audit reporting. According
   * to the Prisma schema comments for todo_app_account_status_changes, each row
   * captures a transition of a user account’s lifecycle status with fields
   * including: target_user_id (required), optional admin_user_id when manually
   * changed, previous_status, new_status, business_reason, has_effect
   * (indicates if a stored transition actually changed state), and timestamps
   * created_at/updated_at. This endpoint exposes a read/search surface for
   * those records while enforcing access control consistent with administrative
   * oversight.
   *
   * Security considerations: Only privileged operators should access another
   * user’s status history. The authorization model therefore limits this
   * operation to system administrators, aligning with the schema’s role
   * assignment model (todo_app_systemadmins) and business requirements that
   * administrators manage account governance. Client implementations should
   * ensure that request filters are validated and that records where deleted_at
   * is populated are excluded from normal responses unless the business logic
   * explicitly permits retention queries.
   *
   * Relationship to underlying entities: Each status change references a
   * subject account via target_user_id (FK to todo_app_users) and optionally an
   * admin_user_id (FK to todo_app_users) when an administrator performed the
   * change. No private todo content is exposed. Indexes on target_user_id and
   * created_at enable efficient retrieval by user and timeline. The response
   * returns records of the todo_app_account_status_changes entity. For
   * cross-referencing administrative actions, see also historical admin
   * operations in todo_app_admin_actions.
   *
   * Validation and business rules: Requests may include filters for time
   * windows based on created_at, enumerated or free-form values for
   * previous_status/new_status (as represented in the schema), boolean
   * filtering on has_effect, and optional filtering by the administrator
   * responsible. Sorting defaults to most recent first, and pagination follows
   * standard page/size conventions defined in the IRequest DTO. This is a
   * read-only operation; it does not create or modify status changes.
   *
   * Related operations: Administrators may also review user governance
   * artifacts through other audit endpoints (e.g., admin actions and audit
   * logs) to build a complete timeline. For account-level summaries, admins
   * would typically first locate the user (outside the scope of this operation)
   * and then drill into status transitions using this route.
   *
   * Expected behavior and errors: If the specified userId is not a valid UUID
   * or does not correspond to an existing user, the service should return a
   * validation or not-found error. Authorization failures should return an
   * appropriate access denial. When filters produce no matches, the response
   * returns an empty page with pagination metadata.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param userId Target user’s ID whose account status changes are being
   *   queried
   * @param body Filter, sort, and pagination criteria for querying account
   *   status changes
