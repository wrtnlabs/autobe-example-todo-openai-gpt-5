   * Search and list guestVisitor assignments (todo_app_guestvisitors) for a
   * user with pagination and filters.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered, paginated list of guestVisitor role assignments for
   * the specified userId from the todo_app_guestvisitors table. According to
   * the Prisma schema description, this model stores multiple historical
   * records per user with granted_at, optional revoked_at, and system-managed
   * created_at/updated_at/deleted_at. The user reference is via
   * todo_app_user_id, enabling queries ordered by granted_at and filtered for
   * current membership where revoked_at IS NULL.
   *
   * Security considerations: Role assignment history is governance data and not
   * user-editable. Access should be restricted to system administrators
   * responsible for audits and operations. Accordingly, the authorization role
   * is systemAdmin. The endpoint is strictly read-only and should implement
   * appropriate rate limits for list operations.
   *
   * Relationships and fields: Each record references todo_app_users through
   * todo_app_user_id. The key fields include granted_at (when the guestVisitor
   * role was granted) and revoked_at (null when still active). No write
   * operations are provided here, aligning with the business rule that role
   * assignments are managed by governance workflows.
   *
   * Query behavior and validation: The request body
   * (ITodoAppGuestVisitor.IRequest) may include pagination parameters (page,
   * pageSize within 1–100), optional filters (e.g., activeOnly—records where
   * revoked_at is null), time range filters on granted_at or revoked_at, and
   * sorting options (e.g., granted_at desc). The implementation should validate
   * page bounds and permitted sort fields, and default sorting by granted_at
   * descending if unspecified.
   *
   * Related operations: Use GET /users/{userId}/guestVisitors/{guestVisitorId}
   * to retrieve a single assignment record by its identifier. No creation,
   * update, or deletion operations are exposed in alignment with the schema’s
   * audit/history intent.
   *
   * Error handling: Return validation errors for unsupported sort fields or
   * out-of-range pagination. If the specified userId does not map to a known
   * user, handle the response generically to avoid disclosing details to
   * unauthorized parties, with explicit checks tied to the administrator role.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param userId Target user’s ID whose guestVisitor assignments will be
   *   listed.
   * @param body Search, filter, sort, and pagination parameters for
   *   guestVisitor history.

   * specific user.
   *
   * Return details of one guestVisitor role assignment from
   * todo_app_guestvisitors using the composite path (userId, guestVisitorId).
   * The Prisma model records role assignment events with fields such as
   * granted_at (grant time), optional revoked_at (revoke time), and
   * system-managed timestamps (created_at, updated_at, deleted_at). The record
   * references the owning user via todo_app_user_id. Although the path scopes
   * by userId, the implementation should still validate that the fetched
   * record’s todo_app_user_id matches the path userId to prevent cross-tenant
   * leakage.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Access is restricted to administrators
   * responsible for governance reviews. Authorization is set to systemAdmin. No
   * modifications are permitted through this endpoint, and it should not reveal
   * data for records that do not belong to the specified user.
   *
   * Entity relationships and validation: Ensure the record’s todo_app_user_id
   * equals the path userId before returning it. The response includes all
   * relevant fields appropriate for administrative review, such as granted_at
   * and revoked_at, but excludes any secret or non-existent attributes as per
   * schema. The model supports historical queries where revoked_at may be null
   * for currently active assignments.
   *
   * Related operations: For broader history and filtering, use PATCH
   * /users/{userId}/guestVisitors. There are no write endpoints for this model
   * because role assignments are managed via governance processes.
   *
   * Error handling: Return not found if guestVisitorId does not exist or does
   * not belong to the specified userId. Handle authorization failures
   * explicitly for non-admin callers.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param userId Owner user’s ID for scoping the role assignment.
   * @param guestVisitorId Identifier of the guestVisitor assignment record to
   *   retrieve.
