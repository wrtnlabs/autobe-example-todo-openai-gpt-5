   * Search IP rate counters (todo_app_ip_rate_counters) with pagination and
   * filters.
   *
   * Retrieve a filtered, paginated list of IP rate counter records from the
   * todo_app_ip_rate_counters table. The schema describes this table as
   * aggregating requests per IP for a given rate limit policy window. Core
   * fields include id (UUID), todo_app_rate_limit_id (FK to
   * todo_app_rate_limits), ip (string IP address), window_started_at,
   * window_ends_at, count, last_action_at, blocked_until, and system timestamps
   * (created_at, updated_at). The table is system-managed and is intended for
   * abuse mitigation and diagnostics where user identity may be absent or
   * unreliable.
   *
   * Security and access: Because IP counters reveal operational telemetry and
   * potentially sensitive infrastructure insights, access should be restricted
   * to system administrators. End users do not manage these records. Providers
   * should by default exclude records flagged for archival via deleted_at,
   * unless explicitly operating in an audit context.
   *
   * Filtering, sorting, and pagination: The request body
   * (ITodoAppIpRateCounter.IRequest) can express filters such as policy
   * association (todo_app_rate_limit_id), partial/normalized IP matching,
   * window time range (window_started_at/window_ends_at), presence of a current
   * block (blocked_until > now), and count thresholds. Sorting may include most
   * recent last_action_at, descending count, or window boundaries. Pagination
   * parameters should include page number/size within business defaults (e.g.,
   * typical 1â€“100 per page), returning a paged response of summaries optimized
   * for list rendering.
   *
   * Error handling and related operations: If filters reference a nonexistent
   * policy, the result is simply an empty page. This list endpoint is commonly
   * used with the detail retrieval GET /ipRateCounters/{ipRateCounterId} to
   * drill into a specific record. As a read-only operation, it performs no side
   * effects.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search criteria, sorting, and pagination for IP rate counters.

  /**
   * Get a single IP rate counter (todo_app_ip_rate_counters) by ID.
   *
   * Fetch detailed information for one IP rate counter from
   * todo_app_ip_rate_counters. Per the schema, this table tracks counts per IP
   * for a configured rate limit policy and window, including fields: id (UUID),
   * todo_app_rate_limit_id (FK to todo_app_rate_limits), ip, window_started_at,
   * window_ends_at, count, last_action_at, blocked_until, and creation/update
   * timestamps. These records are updated by system processes that enforce rate
   * limits and are not user-editable.
   *
   * Security and authorization: The endpoint is intended for system
   * administrators to troubleshoot throttling, investigate abuse patterns, or
   * verify policy effectiveness. Access should be restricted accordingly.
   * Implementations typically exclude records with deleted_at set from normal
   * reads to avoid showing archived entries, unless an audit mode is explicitly
   * enabled.
   *
   * Validation and behavior: The provider should locate the counter by
   * ipRateCounterId. Common uses include checking whether blocked_until is set
   * (indicating an active throttle), reviewing counts within the current window
   * (window_started_at/window_ends_at), and correlating the policy via
   * todo_app_rate_limit_id. Nonexistent IDs should yield a not-found outcome.
   * As a read-only operation, no side effects occur.
