   * Update a single event type (todo_app_event_types) by ID.
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This operation updates a single record in the
   * todo_app_event_types table, which the schema describes as the “Business
   * event taxonomy for todoApp. Each record defines a stable code and
   * human-readable name for a class of events (e.g., "todo.created",
   * "todo.completed").” Administrators use this endpoint to maintain display
   * names, descriptions, and enablement flags as the product evolves, without
   * rewriting historical logs.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Only privileged users should mutate the event
   * taxonomy. Enforce authorization for systemAdmin role. Normal end users
   * (todoUser) and unauthenticated visitors (guestVisitor) are not permitted to
   * update event types.
   *
   * Relationship to underlying entities: The todo_app_business_events model
   * references todo_app_event_types through todo_app_event_type_id for
   * classification, and derived snapshots in todo_app_event_counters_daily and
   * todo_app_aggregated_metrics also depend on these definitions for grouping
   * and reporting. Updates to attributes like name, description, or active
   * influence how future events are emitted and presented, but should not
   * change historical rows already captured.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic: The prisma model enforces a unique
   * index on code (@@unique([code])). If the update attempts to change code, it
   * must remain globally unique and stable; in many deployments, code changes
   * may be disallowed by policy to preserve stable identifiers. The active
   * boolean indicates whether the type is enabled for emission; toggling it to
   * false should prevent new events of that type from being produced by
   * upstream services while leaving existing data intact. Required fields
   * include name and code; optional fields include description. Ensure the
   * eventTypeId is a well-formed UUID and corresponds to an existing record
   * (the model has no deleted_at column).
   *
   * Related operations: Administrators may use GET retrieval or list/search
   * operations for event types (not defined here) to find the appropriate
   * identifier. For analytics and audit, related read-only endpoints on
   * business events and counters reflect the impact of changes to event types.
   * This update operation pairs with the erase endpoint on the same path when a
   * type must be removed.
   *
   * Expected behavior and error handling: The service returns the updated
   * ITodoAppEventType on success. Return validation errors for uniqueness
   * conflicts (code) or missing required fields. Return authorization errors
   * for insufficient privileges and not-found errors when eventTypeId does not
   * exist. Concurrency control should detect lost updates using updated_at
   * semantics implemented in service logic.

  /**
   * Erase an event type (todo_app_event_types) by ID; permanently removes the
   * record.
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This operation deletes a record from
   * todo_app_event_types, the model described as the "Business event taxonomy
   * for todoApp." Removing an event type should be rare and reserved for
   * governance scenarios (e.g., erroneous creation during testing or
   * decommissioning a type that must not exist).
   *
   * Security and permissions: Only system administrators are allowed to perform
   * deletion. This is a sensitive operation because the event taxonomy
   * underpins auditing and analytics classification.
   *
   * Relationship to underlying database entities: todo_app_business_events
   * references todo_app_event_types via todo_app_event_type_id. In the given
   * Prisma schema, the eventType relation uses onDelete: Cascade, which can
   * propagate deletion to dependent business event rows. To preserve
   * audit/analytics history, implement a service-layer guard to block deletion
   * when dependent events exist unless an explicit governed override is
   * provided; otherwise prefer deactivation (active=false) via the update
   * endpoint.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic: The path parameter eventTypeId must be
   * a UUID corresponding to an existing row. Since the model has no deleted_at
   * column, deletion removes the row completely. If business policy requires
   * retention of historical records, administrators should disable the type
   * instead of deleting it.
   *
   * Related operations: Prefer the update endpoint on the same path for
   * non-destructive changes such as toggling active or editing
   * names/descriptions. Use read-only business event endpoints to verify the
   * impact of changes to the taxonomy.
   *
   * Expected behavior and error handling: Return success with no response body
   * when deletion completes. Return not-found for unknown eventTypeId and
   * authorization errors for insufficient permissions. If application-level
   * safeguards prevent deletion due to existing dependencies, return a conflict
   * or policy-violation response with remediation guidance.
