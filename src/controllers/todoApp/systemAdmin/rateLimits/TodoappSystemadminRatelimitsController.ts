   * manage. Key columns include id (UUID primary key), code (unique business

   * "auth"), window_seconds (fixed window duration), max_requests, burst_size
   * (optional), sliding_window (boolean), and enabled (boolean). Timestamps
   * (created_at, updated_at) support administrative review.
   *
   * Access to this endpoint should be restricted to operational administrators
   * responsible for governance. The authorization model should ensure only
   * users with appropriate administrative role can list and inspect these
   * policies. Listings are intended for console pages and audit tools; ordinary
   * end users do not need visibility into these configurations.
   *
   * This operation integrates directly with the todo_app_rate_limits entity and
   * is related to enforcement counters stored in todo_app_user_rate_counters
   * and todo_app_ip_rate_counters, which reference rate limit policies to apply
   * per-subject throttling. While those counter tables are maintained by system
   * logic, administrators depend on this listing to verify which policies are
   * active and how they are configured.
   *
   * Validation and business logic include supporting common filters such as by
   * category, scope, enabled flag, and sliding_window, as well as range filters
   * on window_seconds and max_requests. Sorting typically supports created_at,
   * code, category, and scope. Full-text search can apply to name and
   * description as hinted by the schema's trigram indexes. Error handling
   * should clarify invalid sort keys, unknown filter values, or pagination
   * bounds.

   * attributes including code (unique), scope (e.g., "user", "ip", "global"),

   * timestamp.
   *
   * Access to this operation is restricted to system administrators responsible
   * for governance. It is designed to prevent accidental loss of operational
   * history. Instead of physically removing the row, the provider should set
   * the deleted_at timestamp to indicate the policy is retired. This approach
   * preserves referential integrity and auditability for related counters in
   * todo_app_user_rate_counters and todo_app_ip_rate_counters, which reference
   * todo_app_rate_limits via foreign keys.
   *
   * From a business rules perspective, administrators typically disable
   * enforcement (enabled=false) before retiring a policy to avoid abrupt
   * changes in production. Providers may enforce preconditions such as
   * rejecting removal when enabled=true. The operation should be idempotent:
   * invoking it again on a record already marked as deleted has no additional
   * effect beyond confirming the record remains retired.

   * Error handling includes: 1) returning a not-found style outcome when
   * rateLimitId does not correspond to an existing, currently retained record;
   * 2) conflict-style outcomes when policy constraints require disabling before
   * retirement; and 3) authorization failures for non-admin actors.
