   * (todo_app_rate_limits) via the path parameter rateLimitId. The underlying

   * processes to enforce throttling and cooldown behavior.
   *
   * Security and access: Because this operation surfaces operational telemetry
   * per policy, it should be limited to system administrators. End users have
   * no direct control over these records. Providers should ignore archival rows
   * where deleted_at is set in normal listings unless explicitly operating in
   * an audit context.
   *
   * Filtering and pagination: The request body (ITodoAppIpRateCounter.IRequest)
   * can include additional filters such as IP substring match, window ranges,
   * count thresholds, blocked vs. unblocked state, and sorting preferences
   * (e.g., latest last_action_at first). Pagination should observe business
   * defaults and limits for page size and page index. Records must be filtered
   * to the specified rateLimitId regardless of request body content to avoid
   * cross-policy leakage.
   *
   * Related operations and errors: Use GET /ipRateCounters/{ipRateCounterId} to
   * drill into a single record after identifying it in this list. If the
   * specified rateLimitId does not exist, the operation should return an empty
   * page. As a read-only search, no side effects occur.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param rateLimitId Rate limit policy ID used to constrain IP rate counters.
   * @param body Search criteria, sorting, and pagination; results are
   *   constrained by rateLimitId.

  /**
   * Get an IP rate counter under a rate limit from todo_app_ip_rate_counters.
   *
   * This endpoint retrieves a single IP-based rate counter under a particular
   * rate limit, enabling administrators to inspect throttling state for a given
   * IP within a configured policy window. It operates on the
   * todo_app_ip_rate_counters table, which aggregates request counts per IP and
   * policy window and stores critical fields such as window_started_at,
   * window_ends_at, count, last_action_at, and blocked_until. The parent
   * configuration resides in todo_app_rate_limits, which defines the policy
   * code, scope (e.g., "ip"), category (e.g., "read", "write", "auth"),
   * window_seconds, max_requests, and optional burst_size. This endpoint
   * ensures that the counter returned is scoped to the provided rateLimitId
   * through the foreign key todo_app_rate_limit_id.
   *
   * Security and authorization are restricted to system administrators because
   * these counters expose operational details of enforcement and could reveal
   * sensitive patterns about traffic and abuse protection. Only users with the
   * systemAdmin role should have access. Requests must provide valid UUIDs for
   * both rateLimitId and ipRateCounterId. The service must also ensure that the
   * counterâ€™s todo_app_rate_limit_id equals the path rateLimitId; otherwise,
   * the request is treated as not found to avoid leaking cross-scope
   * information.
   *
   * From a data model perspective, the todo_app_ip_rate_counters table tracks
   * per-policy, per-IP counters using a fixed or sliding window as configured
   * by the linked todo_app_rate_limits record (fields include scope, category,
   * window_seconds, max_requests, burst_size, sliding_window, and enabled).
   * Relevant operational timestamps include last_action_at for the most recent
   * contributing request and blocked_until for the cooldown end time when
   * throttling has been applied. Standard lifecycle timestamps created_at and
   * updated_at are system-managed. Records where deleted_at is non-null are
   * considered deleted and should be excluded from normal responses.
   *
   * Validation and behavior: If either identifier is not a valid UUID, the
   * provider should reject the request. If the ipRateCounterId does not exist,
   * is marked deleted via deleted_at, or exists but is linked to a different
   * rate limit than rateLimitId, the provider should return a not-found
   * outcome. When successful, the response includes the full rate counter
   * entity. This endpoint is read-only and does not modify any counters.
   *
   * Related operations that typically appear alongside this one include a
   * list/search endpoint to filter IP rate counters by rateLimitId and time
   * windows (using pagination and sorting), and administrative actions to view
   * user-level counters (todo_app_user_rate_counters). Write operations
   * (creation, modification, or deletion) for counters are not exposed because
   * counters are system-managed and updated automatically by enforcement
   * logic.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param rateLimitId Identifier of the rate limit policy
   *   (todo_app_rate_limits.id) that owns this counter
   * @param ipRateCounterId Identifier of the IP rate counter record
   *   (todo_app_ip_rate_counters.id) to retrieve
