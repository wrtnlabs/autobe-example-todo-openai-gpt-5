   * Search and paginate business events (todo_app_business_events) with filters
   * and sorting.
   *
   * Purpose and overview: The todo_app_business_events model is described as an
   * "Append-only business event log capturing user-facing domain events across
   * todoApp." Each record references a classification in todo_app_event_types
   * and can optionally reference an actor (todo_app_users), a target todo
   * (todo_app_todos), and a session (todo_app_sessions). This endpoint searches
   * that log with advanced filters to support governance, incident
   * investigation, and operational analytics.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Business event logs often contain sensitive
   * metadata (IP, user agent, and actor linkage). Restrict access to
   * systemAdmin role. End users should not be able to read these records.
   *
   * Relationship to underlying entities: Each event has foreign keys
   * todo_app_event_type_id, todo_app_user_id, todo_app_todo_id, and
   * todo_app_session_id. Queries commonly filter by these, by occurred_at
   * ranges, and by source system. The schema defines helpful indexes, including
   * GIN trigram indexes on message for efficient substring search and indexes
   * on occurred_at and various foreign keys for time-window analytics.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic: The request body
   * (ITodoAppBusinessEvent.IRequest) should support pagination (page,
   * pageSize), sorting (e.g., by occurred_at desc), and filter criteria such as
   * eventTypeId(s), actor userId(s), target todoId(s), sessionId(s), source,
   * ip, and time windows (occurred_at from/to). Free-text search should apply
   * case-insensitive substring matching against message, consistent with
   * schema’s trigram index. Implement rate limiting per policy to protect the
   * service.
   *
   * Related operations: Use GET /businessEvents/{businessEventId} to retrieve a
   * single event’s full details after discovering it in search results.
   * Administrators may also consult daily counters or KPI materialized views
   * through separate analytical endpoints (not defined here).
   *
   * Expected behavior and error handling: On success, return
   * IPageITodoAppBusinessEvent containing pagination metadata and an array of
   * ITodoAppBusinessEvent records. Return validation errors for malformed
   * UUIDs, out-of-range pagination values, or unsupported sort keys. Ensure
   * consistent timezone handling (occurred_at is timestamptz).
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search criteria, pagination, and sorting for business events

  /**
   * Get a single business event (todo_app_business_events) by ID.
   *
   * Purpose and overview: This GET operation retrieves a single append-only
   * record from todo_app_business_events, the schema that captures domain
   * events with references to event types, users, todos, and sessions. It is
   * used when an administrator needs to inspect a specific occurrence
   * identified via search or from a related workflow.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Access should be limited to systemAdmin role due
   * to potentially sensitive content such as IP addresses and user agent
   * strings and the association to specific user identities.
   *
   * Relationship to underlying entities: The record may reference
   * todo_app_event_types (todo_app_event_type_id), todo_app_users
   * (todo_app_user_id), todo_app_todos (todo_app_todo_id), and
   * todo_app_sessions (todo_app_session_id). These relationships enable
   * cross-navigation in administrative consoles and support traceability.
   *
   * Validation rules and business logic: Validate businessEventId as a UUID and
   * ensure the target exists. As events are append-only, there is no mutation
   * or deletion through this endpoint. Ensure consistent timezone presentation
   * for occurred_at (timestamptz) in client applications.
   *
   * Related operations: Combine with the PATCH /businessEvents search endpoint
   * for discovery. Additional analytical endpoints such as daily counters and
   * KPI views are typically used for trend analysis (not part of this API
   * set).
   *
   * Expected behavior and error handling: Return the ITodoAppBusinessEvent
   * record on success. Return not-found for unknown identifiers and
   * authorization errors for insufficient privileges. Avoid exposing unrelated
   * personal data in error details.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param businessEventId Unique identifier of the business event to retrieve
