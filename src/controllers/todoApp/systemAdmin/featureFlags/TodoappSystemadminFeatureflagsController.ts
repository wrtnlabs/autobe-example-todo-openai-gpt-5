   * Create a new feature flag (todo_app_feature_flags).
   *
   * This operation inserts a new feature flag as defined by the Prisma model
   * todo_app_feature_flags. The schema comments emphasize environment and
   * namespace scoping, percentage rollouts, and optional targeting notes.
   * Fields include namespace, environment, code, name, description, active,
   * rollout_percentage, target_audience, start_at, end_at, and lifecycle
   * timestamps (created_at, updated_at, deleted_at). Optional relations to
   * todo_app_service_policies and todo_app_users capture governance and
   * administrative ownership. A composite uniqueness constraint requires that
   * (namespace, code, environment) be unique.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Feature flag creation is an administrative
   * action. Only system administrators should be allowed. The business logic
   * must validate required fields, ensure rollout_percentage is within 0–100,
   * and confirm uniqueness before insertion. Sensitive internal notes should
   * remain in description/targeting fields only if appropriate.
   *
   * Validation and errors: Providers should perform input validation (e.g.,
   * non-empty namespace/code/name, rollout_percentage bounds, start/end window
   * consistency). If a duplicate (namespace, code, environment) exists—even if
   * archived logic is applied—surface a clear conflict error. On success,
   * return the full feature flag entity.
   *
   * Related operations: Use PATCH /featureFlags for listing/searching and GET
   * /featureFlags/{featureFlagId} to view details of the newly created flag.
   * Update and archival endpoints (not included here) typically complete the
   * flag lifecycle.

   *
   * This endpoint lists feature flags stored in the Prisma model
   * todo_app_feature_flags. Per the schema comments, flags enable conditional
   * behavior and staged rollouts. Each flag has namespace, optional
   * environment, code, name, description, an active switch, rollout_percentage
   * (0–100), optional targeting notes, and optional time bounds
   * (start_at/end_at). Administrative actors may associate flags with a

   * todo_app_users capture ownership. The table includes created_at,
   * updated_at, and deleted_at lifecycle columns and GIN indices for
   * name/description to support search.
   *
   * Security considerations: Only system administrators should query full
   * administrative listings, as flags can reveal internal rollout strategies.
   * Although this is a read operation, the data may carry operational
   * sensitivity (e.g., unreleased features). Providers should filter out
   * logically deleted rows (where deleted_at is set) in normal listings unless
   * an explicit include-archived option is requested by policy.
   *
   * Filtering, pagination, and sorting: Business logic should support filters
   * by namespace, environment, code, name, active status, rollout_percentage
   * ranges, association to a specific policy, effective windows
   * (start_at/end_at), and general date ranges (created_at/updated_at).
   * Free-text search should leverage the indexed fields (name, description).
   * Sorting typically includes created_at desc by default, with options to sort
   * by namespace/code/name, active, rollout_percentage, or time windows.
   * Pagination parameters (page number/size) must respect admin-configured
   * limits.
   *
   * Related operations: Use GET /featureFlags/{featureFlagId} to fetch a single
   * flag record and POST /featureFlags to create a new one. Update and archival
   * endpoints would complement this search to form a full administrative
   * workflow.

  /**
   * Get a single feature flag by ID from todo_app_feature_flags.
   *
   * This operation returns the complete details for one feature flag managed in
   * the Prisma model todo_app_feature_flags. As described in the schema, each
   * flag supports environment and namespace scoping, percentage rollouts, and
   * optional targeting metadata. Administrators can link a flag to a governing
   * policy (todo_app_service_policies), and the creator/owner relation to
   * todo_app_users captures administrative attribution. The model also defines
   * created_at, updated_at, and deleted_at timestamps, with search-friendly
   * indexes on name and description.
   *
   * Security: Feature flag definitions often reveal product roadmap and
   * operational strategy. Access should be limited to system administrators.
   * When a flag has been archived (deleted_at set), typical detail retrieval
   * either hides it or returns it with a clear archived indicator, depending on
   * policy.
   *
   * Validation and behavior: The featureFlagId must be a valid UUID. If the
   * identifier does not correspond to an existing row or the flag has been
   * archived, the provider should return an appropriate error or a not-found
   * response consistent with administrative console expectations. This endpoint
   * is typically used after a search or from direct navigation in an admin UI.

  /**
   * Update a feature flag (todo_app_feature_flags) by ID.

   * Update an existing feature flag record in the administration configuration
   * domain. The underlying Prisma model todo_app_feature_flags includes fields
   * for namespace, environment, code, name, description, active,
   * rollout_percentage, target_audience, start_at, end_at, created_at,
   * updated_at, and deleted_at. It also carries optional foreign keys to

   * (todo_app_user_id) noting the administrative owner/creator. As documented
   * in the schema comments, this model supports environment and namespace
   * scoping, percentage rollouts, and optional targeting notes.
   *
   * Security considerations: Only users with the systemAdmin role should be
   * allowed to modify feature flag definitions. The operation must check that
   * the target flag is not logically removed (deleted_at is null) before
   * applying changes. The system should record administrative actions in audit
   * facilities like todo_app_admin_actions and todo_app_audit_logs for
   * governance, attributing the actor and reason when appropriate.
   *
   * This operation updates attributes of the identified flag while respecting
   * database constraints. The unique key across (namespace, code, environment)
   * must not be violated. The rollout_percentage must remain within the 0–100
   * integer range as indicated by the model. When linking to a policy via
   * todo_app_service_policy_id, the referenced todo_app_service_policies record
   * must exist and be appropriate for the intended governance. The updated_at
   * column should reflect the modification time; created_at is immutable by
   * clients.
   *
   * Related operations may include listing or retrieving feature flags for
   * administration, or deleting a flag to remove it from evaluation. On errors,

   * from normal operations. When this endpoint is invoked by an authorized
   * systemAdmin, the implementation should transition the record to a deleted
