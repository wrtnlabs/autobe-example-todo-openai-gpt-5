  /**
   * Delete a service configuration by ID in todo_app_service_configurations
   * (logical deletion via deleted_at).
   *
   * This operation targets the Systematic configuration store represented by
   * the Prisma model todo_app_service_configurations. According to the schema
   * comments, it manages key/value settings grouped by namespace and optionally
   * by environment, with an explicit value_type to inform runtime
   * interpretation. Records carry flags such as is_secret to indicate sensitive
   * contents and active to control evaluation, as well as effective_from and
   * effective_to to bound their applicability. The model enforces a uniqueness
   * constraint across (namespace, key, environment) and provides relations to a
   * governing policy (todo_app_service_policies) and an administrative user
   * (todo_app_users).
   *
   * Security and permissions: Configuration lifecycle is an administrative
   * responsibility. Access is therefore restricted to system administrators.
   * Since the table includes sensitive configuration values (some marked as
   * is_secret), responses, logs, and business logic must ensure secrets are not
   * exposed inadvertently during deletion workflows.
   *
   * Behavior and lifecycle: Because todo_app_service_configurations has a
   * deleted_at column, deletion is implemented by marking the record as deleted
   * (setting deleted_at). This ensures the record is excluded from normal flows
   * while preserving historical context and references. Consider how uniqueness
   * rules and any downstream caches behave after deletion. If your system
   * requires re-introducing a configuration with the same (namespace, key,
   * environment), ensure that either the existing record is updated/reused or
   * your business logic supports handling archived entries appropriately.
   *
   * Validation and errors: The endpoint expects a valid UUID for
   * configurationId. If the record does not exist or is already deleted,
   * providers should respond idempotently—acknowledging the state without
   * exposing sensitive details. Related APIs include listing and detail
   * retrieval endpoints for configurations (not covered here) and policy
   * management endpoints if configurations are governed by
   * todo_app_service_policies.
